Absolutely. Below is a **design-forward, product-grade spec** you can hand directly to Replit. It is intentionally detailed enough that a designer-engineer can execute without guessing, while still leaving room for taste.

This spec covers **Splash Screen + Welcome Screen only**, but treats them as a *system*, not decoration.

---

# 🎨 CarbScan Splash + Welcome Experience

**Design & Implementation Spec for Replit**

You are designing the **very first 1–2 seconds** of CarbScan.
This moment should communicate three things, immediately and subconsciously:

1. **Speed** – this app is fast and competent
2. **Clarity** – this app understands a real problem
3. **Humanity** – this app is designed for real life, not clinics

This is not a logo parade.
This is a calm, confident system handshake.

---

## 🎯 Goals (in priority order)

1. App feels **instant** (no perceived loading)
2. Brand feels **thoughtful and modern**
3. User feels **welcome, not marketed to**
4. Transition into onboarding feels seamless

---

## Overall Brand Direction (Guiding Principles)

* **Warm precision**
* **Human but not cute**
* **Delight through restraint**
* **Confidence without hype**

Think:

* Stripe product surfaces
* Linear’s calm authority
* Apple system feedback
* Duolingo *without* the cartoon energy

---

## 1) Splash Screen (0.5–1.0 seconds)

### Purpose

Signal competence and speed while the app initializes.
This should feel like a system boot, not an ad.

### Duration

* **Target:** 500–800ms
* **Hard max:** 1.2s
* Must be skippable instantly if app is already warm

---

### Visual Design

#### Background

* Solid color
* Two recommended options:

  * **Soft off-white** (`#FAFAF8`)
  * **Very light warm gray** (`#F4F4F2`)
* No gradients
* No texture

#### Logo

* Centered
* Simple CarbScan wordmark or icon
* Single color (charcoal or near-black)
* No animation on the logo itself

#### Optional micro-motion (very subtle)

Choose **one**, not both:

**Option A: Line draw-in**

* Thin stroke (1–1.5px)
* Logo outline draws in over ~300ms
* Easing: ease-out
* Feels like “initializing”

**Option B: Opacity fade**

* Logo fades from 0 → 100%
* 200–300ms
* Almost imperceptible

No bounce. No scale. No flair.

---

### Technical Notes

* Use native splash where possible (Expo `splash`)
* Avoid JS-driven animation if it risks jank
* Splash should disappear immediately once JS is ready

---

## 2) Welcome Screen (Brand Moment + Invitation)

This is the **first real screen**.
It replaces the idea of a traditional “hero marketing screen.”

---

### Screen Name

`WelcomeScreen`

---

### Layout Structure (Top → Bottom)

1. **Illustration / Line Art Area**
2. **Brand Statement (1 sentence)**
3. **Primary Action**
4. **Secondary Trust Line**

---

### 1) Illustration / Line Art Area (Delight Moment)

This is the personality.

#### Style

* **Single-line or minimal line art**
* Stroke weight: thin (1–1.5px)
* No fill, or extremely subtle fill
* One accent color max

#### Subject Matter (rotate randomly or pick one)

* A plate with imperfect food portions
* A bowl with mixed ingredients
* A snack wrapper partially open
* A fork hovering over a plate
* A camera outline framing food

Nothing aspirational.
Nothing “healthy lifestyle” coded.
Just *food, as it is*.

#### Motion (optional, highly recommended)

* 1–2 second loop
* Very subtle:

  * Line gently draws and undraws
  * Small parallax drift
  * Soft breathing motion (1–2px movement)

Motion must:

* Never distract
* Never delay interaction
* Pause when app backgrounded

---

### 2) Brand Statement (Core Line)

This is *not* marketing copy.
It’s a calm framing of value.

**Primary option**

> **“Understand carbs as easily as taking a photo.”**

**Alternates (for A/B later)**

* “Carb clarity, one photo at a time.”
* “Carbs, without the guesswork.”
* “See the carbs. Decide with confidence.”

Typography:

* Large, readable
* Not bold
* Max 2 lines
* Centered or left-aligned depending on system style

---

### 3) Primary Action

This should feel like an invitation, not a funnel.

**Button**

* Label: **“Scan a meal”**
* Full width
* Strong contrast
* Rounded but not pill-shaped
* Immediate tactile feedback

Interaction:

* Tap → goes directly to camera flow
* If permission needed, handled contextually later

---

### 4) Secondary Trust Line

Small, quiet reassurance.

Examples:

* “No account needed to try.”
* “Takes just a few seconds.”
* “Built for real meals.”

Font:

* Small
* Muted color
* Never clickable

---

## Motion & Transitions

* Welcome screen should **slide or fade in seamlessly** from splash
* No hard cuts
* Transition into onboarding should feel continuous
* When user taps “Scan a meal,” illustration subtly fades out while camera loads

---

## Performance Requirements (Critical)

* Welcome screen must render in <16ms on modern devices
* Illustration must be:

  * SVG or Lottie
  * No large PNGs
* All assets bundled locally (no network)

If performance drops, **remove motion before removing illustration**.

---

## Accessibility

* Illustration is decorative, marked `accessibilityHidden`
* Text contrast AA compliant
* Button hit area ≥44px
* Supports Dynamic Type

---

## Analytics (Light)

Track:

* `splash_shown`
* `welcome_viewed`
* `welcome_cta_tapped`
* Time from app open → CTA tap

Do not over-instrument.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Do NOT Do These)

* No loading spinners
* No slogans about health, diabetes, or control
* No emoji
* No mascot
* No “Get Started” button
* No modal popups
* No permission prompts here

---

## Implementation Notes for Replit

* Implement Splash using Expo config
* WelcomeScreen as first React Navigation route
* Illustration component isolated for iteration
* Copy sourced from config for easy experimentation

---

## North Star Test

Ask this question:

> “Does this feel like a calm, confident tool I can trust with daily decisions?”

If it feels loud, clever, or salesy, it’s wrong.

---

If you want next, I can:

* Design **3 concrete illustration concepts** (described for an illustrator or Lottie designer)
* Write a **mini brand style guide** (colors, type, spacing)
* Or convert this into a **Replit agent task list** with acceptance criteria

This is the right place to invest polish.
